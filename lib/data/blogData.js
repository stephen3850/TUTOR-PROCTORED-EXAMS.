          <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Your Work Surface:</strong> Remove all secondary monitors, scratch paper (unless explicitly allowed), textbooks, smartphones, and unauthorized electronics from arm’s reach.</li>
            <li><strong>Lighting Considerations:</strong> Ensure overhead or desk lighting illuminates your face clearly without creating heavy background glares or dark shadows that trigger camera warnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Room Setting:</strong> Choose a quiet room with a closeable door. Notify housemates or family members that an official exam is underway to prevent accidental interruptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Desk & Chair Placement:</strong> Position your chair so the camera captures your full face and upper shoulders clearly throughout the session.</li>
